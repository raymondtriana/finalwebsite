        <p>Due to the rapid growth of the internet in China, reaching a penetration rate of 53.2 percent by 2016, The Great Firewall poses a massive problem for those wishing to express themselves freely (<a href="workcited.html">Zhong, Wang, Huang 974</a>). Through efforts such as 
            <a href="glossary.html#ACL">ACL (Access Control List) </a> tampering, <a href="glossary.html#URL">URL</a> and <a href="glossary.html#DNS">DNS</a> blocking, <a href="glossary.html#BGP">BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)</a> hijacking, and <a href="glossary.html#keywordblocking">keyword blocking</a> The CCP makes it extremely difficult to access content not deemed appropriate to them. ACL tampering includes the ability to change privileges on certain files on a computer which includes who can read or write to it. Imagine a situation where the government has the ability to make a video on your computer inaccessible to you by changing certain privileges linked to your account on a public computer. DNS blocking includes the ability to block certain DNS servers responsible with leading people to websites. BGP hijacking is the ability to reroute internet traffic to a different destination. This is akin to creating a new off ramp on the internet highway where instead of visiting a certain webpage on Wikipedia about the Tiananmen Square incident you are sent to a page curated by the government. Keyword blocking is the last tactic used where certain words deemed inappropriate are blocked within search results.</p>
<p>
        This could be due to a simple lack of results or an outright popup warning you about searching for a topic. This plan to censor is not just done in the public sector however, ISPs (Internet Service Providers) who operate within the country must follow stringent screening on information and delete content that could harm "the security of nation, the unity of ethnic groups and the stability of the society, and those spreading rumor, pornography, and violence" (Zhong, Wang, Huang 975). Bypassing this Great Firewall seems like a near impossibility. With the blocking of URLs and ISPs being involved it is extremely difficult to download software that could help. However, free and open-source options such as <a href="glossary.html#TOR">Tor</a> and <a href="glossary.html#VPN">VPNs</a> would be able to bypass the firewall as shown in <a href="The_CCPs_Censorship_of_The_Internet.html">Zhong, Wang, and Huang's experiment</a> (<a href="workcited.html">981</a>).<br>
