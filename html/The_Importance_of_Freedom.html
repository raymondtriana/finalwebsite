        <h4>The importance of free speech</h4>
        <p>Unfortunately, even with all of the technology in the world the ultimate limiter of speech is knowledge. Most people have no idea what Tor, Tails, or Linux are and are at the mercy of those who wish to control them. This has led to countless arguments about our society’s ever-increasing addiction to monopolistic corporations and the governments that are even above them. And as each day passes more and more of our data is stolen from us and distributed to people we will never meet. Ultimately, the reality is that all parties big or small are formed from humans who act together in a common purpose. Those who wish to control the public’s voices are simply another man or woman who thinks they are smarter or more valuable than another. The choice to advocate for more censorship, to the point of wishing for posts to be removed before even being posted, is wishing to allow a group of individuals that we never voted for to tell us to shut up and form a line. The right to privacy is inalienable and although many malefactors will use it for evil those who wish to use it for good, to talk to journalists, expose corruption, and live freely shouldn’t be torched along with those spreading dangerous material. As adults we have the ability to think for ourselves and do our own research and while fake news and propaganda are serious issues worthy of attention it should not be a scapegoat to allow an ever shrinking pool of elites to control the voice of the masses. With the age of internet upon us it seems only fitting to use the internet to the fullest extent that Tim Berners-Lee envisioned. A world of endless information where your can share ideas without the worry of busy bodies controlling information. Even with the dangers involved the upside is a better sense of freedom in what to learn and engage with.</p>
