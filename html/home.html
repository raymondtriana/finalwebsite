        <h4>The importance of free speech</h4>
        <p>In our modern world there is an increasing reliance on the power of the internet. Messaging boards and forums are no longer tight knit communities of a few hundred. Most large businesses offering a platform for speech hold such power over communication that the question of where a public square begins, and private company ends is a constant dilemma. From President Trump’s controversial de-platforming to outright genocide being facilitated through the internet, control over who speaks is an endless drive for governments worldwide. I intend to shine a light upon the tactics of multiple actors including governments and companies around the world to promote a culture of censorship and the tools available to those that want to speak freely and anonymously. After all anonymity is a right to us all and the ability to share our ideas shouldn’t be governed by nameless faceless entities behind closed doors.</p>
