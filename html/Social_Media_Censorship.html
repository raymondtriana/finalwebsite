                <h4>Social Media Censorship</h4>
                
                
                <p>An important thing to remember is that states are not the only ones in charge of speech. One could argue that corporations whose control over the internet is near monopolistic have more sway than The CCP's Great Firewall ever could. Many social media platforms lack a distinct border between following and breaking rules leading to many people using coded language or outright avoiding controversial issues. One example of this in action in The United States would be avoiding topics involving serious crimes against minors or sensitive political topics in order to escape potential censorship by YouTube's algorithm. While this may seem insignificant when compared to a state's attempt to control an entire population social media could essentially act as The CCP of the west if not in check. This need to allow control over what can or can not be seen online is often times predicated on the idea of stopping hateful speech. While it is admirable to stop hateful speech that causes harm to others there is always the question of if censoring what someone deems as hateful could lead to unintended consequences.
                Most countries in the western world have some form of regulation on speech. While non are as extreme as The CCP, some countries seem to wish for more censorship as a means to protect the psychological well-being of internet users. These restrictions on speech are generally to help protected groups and is based on the term hate speech which lacks a universally agreed upon definition. Generally, people would say that racism and sexism constitute hate speech, but criticism of immigrants may or may not. Anyone could be an immigrant and the term doesn't involve protected characteristics and is thus not considered hate speech in countries like the UK (<a href="workcited.html">Stefanie, Tomalin 70</a>). This has caused a push for social media companies like Facebook to update their community standard to include immigration as a protected group (<a href="workcited.html">Stefanie, Tomalin 70</a>).</p>

<p class="leftpquote">"Freedom of speech is a principal pillar of a free government; when this support is taken away, the constitution of a free society is dissolved, and tyranny is erected on its ruins." - Benjamin Franklin</p>

<p>
The major concern in the west is the lack of public accountability monopolistic social media companies have. While some may be able to protest the government, vote, or even run for office the only choice when it comes to censorship within the private sector is the use of another platform. While this sounds easy, the reality is that the control companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter have over internet discourse is enormous and it's unlikely that any of them would sit back and allow a competitor to arrive with the promise of uncensored speech.
While no one condones hateful speech, advocating for more power over what's allowed when the law isn't broken may cause more harm than good as large corporations and governments generally never relinquish the power given to them. If corporations whose power is akin to monopolies are given the ability to censor what is deemed as hateful within their own guidelines without needing to justify further what is to stop them from de-platforming in the same way The CCP does. Currently, social media implements a reactive approach to hate speech, but research is actively done to create algorithms to essentially live out Minority Report online. These algorithms would use machine learning along with data sets of what constitutes different types of hate speech to quarantine posts pre-emptively. A concerning part of this plan is the use of "sociolinguistic features concerning the user's background, posting history, and online characteristics [which] have been included in the development and training of classifiers" (<a href="workcited.html">Stefanie, Tomalin 73</a>). While this may seem like the harmless profiling of neo-Nazis or terrorists the need to look at how rules could be abused is always there. If for example, a person is mass reported constantly through targeted campaigns would they be seen by an ever-learning AI as a new classifier for an offender? Would they potentially have posts taken down prematurely to protect the mentally thin skinned? After all, "it would be far better to intercept potentially offensive posts at an earlier stage of the process, ideally before they have been read by the intended recipient."  (<a href="workcited.html">Stefanie, Tomalin 73</a>).
This possibility of restricting posts before they can be uploaded is a very dangerous road to go down as all trust is put into the hands of large corporations. After all, if you could never have seen the 'potentially harmful' post before it was preemptively taken down whose to say it did or didn't break the rules besides the company themselves? This has led to a far more acceptable alternative in the form of quarantining. Quarantining essentially adds a popup, warning you of potentially dangerous information when you interact with a post. This allows for a middle ground between hard core free speech advocates and those who believe in censoring certain content. While what to police and the response to offenses is debated, one solution would be to understand that the inherent anonymity of the internet is both a blessing and curse. Being able to hide your identity can be useful when saying things that could put you in harms way by real life retaliation from governments or criminals. Anonymity has a valid use even today as pen names were throughout history. However, the obsession over the internet by society at large is a crippling addiction. Stories of people doing outrageous acts online just for view or likes is heartbreaking and the reality that people would gladly allow censorship just so they don't see mean words on their feed is saddening. Truly hateful content leading to death and criminal activity is undoubtably unacceptable, but the fear of allowing large corporations to preemptively tell the public what they can engage with as if they were mindless dogs trained to bark at whoever stepped out of line is outrageous.

<p>
And with the endless attempts to police content by governments and corporations more tech savvy individuals have led projects to allow uncensored and unregulated speech. These include technologies such as Tor, Torrenting, and peer to peer communications. Freedom however comes with responsibilities as some of these technologies can lead to criminal behavior and the most hateful content there is being spread like wildfire.
