                <p><a href="glossary.html#TOR">Tor</a> (The Onion Router) is a free and open-source networking technology which is focused on privacy. It works by rerouting your IP traffic through a worldwide network of relays to obscure your location. It constantly randomizes what relays you use and always uses a minimum of three relays before a connection to your destination is established. For example, entering google,com into your search bar may send you to a relay in Germany, then Korea, then Argentina before accessing the website. This will make it look as if you were in Argentina and if someone were to decrypt the packet by one layer they would see you were in Korea and so on. While this does cause a performance drop as websites now take longer to load it is very beneficial when trying to mask who you are under an authoritarian state.</p>
                <p class="rightpquote">"Intellectual property is an important legal and cultural issue. Society as a whole has complex issues to face here: private ownership vs. open source, and so on." - Tim Berners-Lee</p>
                <p>
                While Tor has an extremely bad reputation due to its prevalent use to distribute abhorrent illegal material it is also used in very crucial ways. Journalists such as those from Reporters Without Borders have historically used Tor in order to safely and anonymously communicate with whistleblowers. Even the US government uses Tor, in fact they are the original developers of it with 60% of its funding originating from the State Department and Department of Defense (<a href="workcited.html">The Tor Project</a>). Tor seems like a foolproof way to avoid surveillance as even the US government trusts it but there are still some precautions to take. When accessing a webpage within the Tor network your identity is encrypted and the addresses of the nodes you are hopping to are attached to the internet packet containing your IP and destination address. Each node then decrypts the top layer in the packet to reveal the IP of the next node. This continues on until the final node decrypts the packet and reveals the IP of your destination. This technology makes it extremely difficult to monitor someone unless they are intercepting the data between the final relay node and the destination as this is where all layers of the packet are decrypted. Due to this there is extreme risk in hosting an exit node relay and many ISPs will block its users from maintaining an exit node relay as to avoid legal problems due to Tor infamy for powering the dark web.
Unfortunately, the dark web’s existence is propped up by Tor as to find someone on the network you must either control all relays they used or decrypt a minimum of three layers of encryption to find the source of a packet. This is the trade off of anonymity on the internet. It’s ironic that advocating for privacy means privacy for criminals as well who will use their anonymity to monstrous ends. Many infamous websites such as The Silk Road have used amazing technologies like Tor to sell all manners of illegal products and became a billion-dollar drug market run off of cryptocurrencies and Tor’s anonymity.
Ultimately, no efforts to hide oneself is successful if you don’t know what your computer is doing. Computer programs generally fall into two categories, proprietary and open-source. Proprietary programs are programs whose code is not accessible to the public and thus there are constant questions as to what these programs are doing. Many people go as far as to say programs such as Windows itself holds backdoor access to the NSA and with the code being only available to Microsoft there is no way to disprove this beyond extreme levels of cyber security analysis. Contrary to this is open-source programs such as <a href="The_Linux_Operating_System.html">GNU/Linux.</a>
