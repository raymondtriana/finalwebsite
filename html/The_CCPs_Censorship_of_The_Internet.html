                <p>Control over the internet is a near impossibility. The sheer amount of data being shared can only be controlled by a combination of self-censorship and internet algorithms. The most popular example of this tactic is <a href="The_Chinese_Iron_Curtain.html">The Great Firewall of China</a>, a massive internet regulation system which filters content deemed as untrue or sensitive by the Chinese Government.</p>
                <p>
                    Due to the rapid growth of the internet in China, reaching a penetration rate of 53.2 percent by 2016, The Great Firewall poses a massive problem for those wishing to express themselves freely (<a href="workcited.html">Zhong, Wang, Huang 974</a>). Through efforts such as ACL (Access Control List) tampering, URL and DNS blocking, BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) hijacking, and keyword blocking The CCP makes it extremely difficult to access content not deemed appropriate to them. ACL tampering includes the ability to change privileges on certain files on a computer which includes who can read or write to it. Imagine a situation where the government has the ability to make a video on your computer inaccessible to you by changing certain privileges linked to your account on a public computer. DNS blocking includes the ability to block certain DNS servers responsible with leading people to websites. BGP hijacking is the ability to reroute internet traffic to a different destination. This is akin to creating a new off ramp on the internet highway where instead of visiting a certain webpage on Wikipedia about the Tiananmen Square incident you are sent to a page curated by the government. Keyword blocking is the last tactic used where certain words deemed inappropriate are blocked within search results. This could be due to a simple lack of results or an outright popup warning you about searching for a topic. This plan to censor is not just done in the public sector however, <a href="glossary.html#ISP">ISPs</a> (Internet Service Providers) who operate within the country must follow stringent screening on information and delete content that could harm "the security of nation, the unity of ethnic groups and the stability of the society, and those spreading rumor, pornography, and violence" (<a href="workcited.html">Zhong, Wang, Huang 975</a>). Bypassing this Great Firewall seems like a near impossibility. With the blocking of URLs and ISPs being involved it is extremely difficult to download software that could help. However, free and open-source options such as <a href="glossary.html#TOR">Tor</a> and <a href="glossary.html#VPN">VPNs</a> would be able to bypass the firewall as shown in Zhong, Wang, and Huang's experiment (<a href="workcited.html">981</a>).
                </p>
                <p class="rightpquote">"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers." - United Nations, Universal Declaration of Human Rights</p>
                <p>
                    This experiment was done to monitor if people were more likely to self-censor under certain conditions. These conditions were under "soft censorship", "hard censorship", and "justification to censorship". The soft censorship group experienced multiple popups warning of their searches on Baidu. The hard censorship group were allowed to use VPNs to bypass the firewall and experienced different searches on YouTube and Google as the researchers pretended to be called by the government to stop their experiment. Some subjects of both groups were also given articles justifying censorship by the government. Results showed that the experimental groups had a significant difference from the control group as they were less likely to engage in petitions with their real names or conversations about sensitive topics. This study was unique in the sense that it covered the behavior of the average Chinese citizen when exposed to the truth about The Great Firewall and proved that knowledge of being censored leads to a change in behavior.
                    This change in behavior is obvious when looking through the eyes of an average citizen living in these conditions. Imagine living in a bubble cut off from the rest of the world. All you've ever known is what was carefully presented to you by a force you'll never see. It is essentially a nationwide echo chamber akin to social media where all are subscribed to The CCP's newsfeed. However, while this control may seem ironclad, some argue that it's all a ruse upheld by those being controlled. Similar to a large business only being able to operate as long as the workers are willing to labor, censorship on the internet may actually be reliant on the collective self-censorship of the people (<a href="workcited.html">Druzin and Gordon, 1427</a>).<br>
                    The sheer volume of information circling the internet is impossible to police successfully but is critical to controlling the masses. Thus, authoritarian governments will use a combination of direct and indirect control. As Druzin and Gordon put it "[internet censorship] is constructed upon the shaky edifice of collective paranoia fragile foundation that can crumble as the result of small, individual acts of defiance..." (<a href="workcited.html">1428</a>). This is of course a bold statement as most people imagine an iron curtain of endless government agents patrolling what's available online when it comes to internet censorship. However, the reality is governments or even private companies training the public to police itself. One tactic described is the construction of informational uncertainty where the state deliberately blurs the line between permissible and impermissible speech.
