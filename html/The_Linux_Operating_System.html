                <p>Linux is a family of operating systems which run on the Linux kernel developed by Linus Torvalds. Linux, due to being open-source, can be downloaded and its code can be modified to fit whatever purpose deemed necessary. This has caused Linux’s popularity among computer giants to explode to the point of where a vast majority of the internet’s servers use Linux as their operating system. Even the smartphone operating system Android is a variant of Linux whose code has been modified to run optimally on smartphones.
With this extreme level of freedom to modify and distribute a massive community of developers from individual hobbyists to massive companies have a vested interest in keeping Linux up to date and secure. And as the code is public it is very hard to sneak in potential security risks as all individuals using it would be affected. This causes variants of Linux such as Tails to be an obvious choice for those wishing to stay anonymous under tyranny. Tails is a variant of Linux which runs exclusively off of a USB stick. When plugged into a computer and booted from Tails will copy itself into the RAM of the device. This allows you to use it without the worry of data being left on the computer’s hard drive to identify you as RAM only remembers data as long the computer is on. Once the computer is turned off the data within RAM is deleted. Tails also implements the Tor network and as described earlier Tor’s multi-layer encryption of internet packets in tandem with Tails’ ability to only stay active as long as the computer is on and its inability to save data means that identifying you as the user is almost impossible.
With all of these technologies at someone’s disposal it seems obvious that governments who wish to restrict freedom would ban them. China did just that by banning access to the Tor network due to its ability to undermine its Iron Curtain (<a href="workcited.html">MIT Technology Review</a>). To combat this, Tor released a technology known as meek which is a “new pluggable transport for censorship circumvention” (<a href="workcited.html">The Tor Project</a>). Meek is in charge of talking to a Tor relay while appearing to be talking to a different website. These Tor relays act as stepping stones into the Tor network allowing the circumvention of censorship. This allows users in China, Belarus, Iran, and Kazakhstan whose governments limit Tor’s usage to still access the internet and speak anonymously without the fear of retaliation. 
Some of these relays use a protocol known as obfs4 which is a pluggable transport whose purpose is to hide the identifiable patterns of a Tor connection. Normally, it's possible to fingerprint Tor traffic based on patterns of bytes that appear in it and once a government analyzes that someone is using Tor to avoid censorship, they could order ISPs to blacklist Tor relays. Pluggable transports will alter these bytes in order to look as if the user is using a non-Tor protocol for communication, or to make the bytes as random as possible, and ultimately avoid IP-based tracking to avoid blacklists. This is extremely effective as the bytes themselves will be masked to look like a normal email or video instead of a onion link on the dark web allowing a user to circumvent even the most secure crackdowns. The only downside is the need for more and more relays as they will eventually get blacklisted once found.
